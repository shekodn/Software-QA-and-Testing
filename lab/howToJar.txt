1) Ensure that all necessary files are within the directory, you have opened a terminal/Command Prompt and have navigated to that directory.

2) Compile the .java class, for example HelloWorld.java with

javac HelloWorld.java
3) This will produce a .class file needed for the JAR file.

4) Next create a manifest file (saved using the extension .txt) using the text editor and input the following

Main-Class: HelloWorld
or whatever your file's name is.

5) Next create the JAR file using this code:

jar cfm HelloWorld.jar Manifest.txt HelloWorld.class
6) Run the file:

java -jar HelloWorld.jar
If anything seems unclear consult these websites: creating a jar file and setting an applications entry point.

Hope this helps others, cheers Tom!

Edit:

Following inga's comment it's worth noting that in order to include multiple files in the jar you need to use the:

javac *.java
followed by

jar cfm HelloWorld.jar Manifest.txt *.class
